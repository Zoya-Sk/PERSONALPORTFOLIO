          About Me
        </h2>

        <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Hi! I'm <span className="font-semibold text-indigo-600">Zoya Shaikh</span>, a passionate tech student currently pursuing a degree in BSc-IT. I have a keen interest in software development and web design, with hands-on experience in technologies like the MERN Stack. I also have a strong foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms in Java.
        </p>

        <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
           I completed my MERN Stack Teaching Assistant Internship (Remote, Part-time) at Stealth Ed-Tech Startup from July 2025 to December 2025, where I guided and mentored 5,000+ students in MERN stack concepts, resolved 460+ technical doubts related to full-stack development and project implementation, and maintained a strong learner satisfaction record with an average rating of 4.62/5.
        </p>

        <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
          During my studies, I’ve worked on multiple projects that strengthened my coding skills - including building responsive websites and solving real-world challenges with efficient algorithms. I’m always eager to learn new technologies and tackle complex problems.
        </p>

        <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Looking ahead, I aspire to work as a software developer and continue improving my technical abilities and knowledge.
        </p>

        <p className="text-base sm:text-sm leading-relaxed font-bold">
          "When I’m not coding, I enjoy learning new things beyond tech. I also love spending time on personal growth and skill-building.
          Feel free to explore my projects or connect with me!"
